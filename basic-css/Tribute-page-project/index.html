        <p><strong> Subhas Chandra Bose</strong> (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an <strong>Indian
                nationalist</strong> whose defiance of British authority in India made him a <strong>hero</strong> among
            many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by
            <strong>authoritarianism</strong>, <strong>anti-Semitism</strong>, and <strong>military</strong> failure.
            The honorific Netaji (Bengali: <strong>"Respected Leader"</strong>) was first applied to Bose in Germany in
            early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the
            Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India</p>

                <p>Bose's legacy is mixed. Among many in India, he is seen as a hero, his saga serving as a would-be
                    counterpoise to the
                    many actions of regeneration, negotiation, and reconciliation over a quarter-century through which
                    the independence of
                    India was achieved.
